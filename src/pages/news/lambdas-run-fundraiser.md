This September, we organized a fundraiser called Lambdas Run and aimed to raise $300 for the UVA Health COVID-19 philanthropic fund by asking our friends and family to sponsor a brother and donate $1 for every mile that they completed. We excited and extremely grateful to have announce that we surpassed our initial goal and raised a total of $1,750! We would like to extend a sincere thank you to those that sponsored a brother and to all who helped us during the fundraiser.

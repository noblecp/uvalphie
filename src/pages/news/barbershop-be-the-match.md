The Alpha Tau Chapter of Lambda Phi Epsilon at UVA ran a fundraiser to support Be The Match, the National Bone Marrow Donor registry.

Donations in a brother's name counted towards a "bounty" on their hair. They had a chance to save their hair by matching or exceeding the cumulative donations by the deadline.

Bonus: Those who signed up for the Be The Match registry will get 1 vote towards a brother and whoever has the most votes by the deadline had an additional buyout of $100 on top of their existing bounty to save their hair!

Overall, after collecting all donations we raised a total of **$3574** and donated it to Be The Match. Our Vice President of Service, Ryan Jansen, has also shaved his head given the success of the event.
